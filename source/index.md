# Platform Overview

The Bill.com Developer Platform lets you interact with the Bill.com service through easy-to-use APIs, enabling you to automate the actions that a Bill.com user would perform through our application. This documentation walks you through various aspects of the platform, to get you started on building a high-quality integration with Bill.com. 

# API Mechanics

This section describes the mechanics of Bill.com API - the end points, request and response formats as well as error handling. 
End Points

Login API requests always need to use the URL: https://api.bill.com/api/v2/

The subsequent calls should be made to the apiEndPoint (refered as <API End Point URL>  throughout this document) returned on the Login call.  All entities (exceptions noted) can be created, updated and read using the same set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update & Delete) operations. The API end point follows the format :  <API End Point URL>/Crud/<Operation>/<Entity>.json where Operation is one of the following: Create, Update, Read, Delete, Undelete. 

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>
